The overall sentiment of the text is hedonistic and celebratory. While the repeated requests for alcohol could be interpreted as a negative expression of dependence, the context, primarily a song lyric, suggests a celebratory and perhaps even humorous tone. The mentions of partying, dancing, and wealth further contribute to a positive, albeit potentially irresponsible, atmosphere.
